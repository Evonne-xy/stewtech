Our vision - Increasing cyclist safety through education, awareness, and transparency of high risk zones and ensured best practices

 
Plans for the City of Melbourne to repurpose some public roads and on-street parking by 2030, alongside the Department of Transports Cycling Strategy 2028, will lead to an expected increase in cyclist volume in coming years.

Cyclists constitute 20% of all transport related hospitalisations. The largest contributors to at-fault cyclist accidents are primarily a lack of care and attention and ignoring basic road rules. This highlights the need for increased clarity and transparency on high-risk incident locations, as well as the development of best practice resources for ensured road safety of cyclists.

With STEW, we will help create a safer community for cyclists, and through sharing a common goal with the Victorian and Melbourne governments, increase cyclist safety and participation

Traveling smarter, cycling safer is our calling.
