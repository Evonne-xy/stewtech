Our vision - Increasing cyclist safety through education, awareness, and transparency of high risk zones and ensured best practices

 
Plans for the City of Melbourne to repurpose some public roads and on-street parking by 2030, alongside the Department of Transports Cycling Strategy 2028, will lead to an expected increase in cyclist volume in coming years.

Cyclists constitute 20% of all transport related hospitalisations. The largest contributors to at-fault cyclist accidents are primarily a lack of care and attention and ignoring basic road rules. This highlights the need for increased clarity and transparency on high-risk incident locations, as well as the development of best practice resources for ensured road safety of cyclists.

With STEW, we will help create a safer community for cyclists, and through sharing a common goal with the Victorian and Melbourne governments, increase cyclist safety and participation

Traveling smarter, cycling safer is our calling.

我们的愿景——通过教育、意识和高风险区域的透明度，提高骑行者的安全，并确保最佳实践。将导致未来几年自行车数量的预期增长。骑自行车的人占所有交通相关住院人数的20%。造成自行车事故的最大因素主要是缺乏关心和注意，以及忽视基本的道路规则。这突出表明，需要提高事故高危地点的透明度和透明度，并为确保骑自行车者的道路安全开发最佳实践资源。

通过STEW，我们将帮助为骑行者创建一个更安全的社区，通过与维多利亚州和墨尔本政府共享一个共同的目标，增加骑行者的安全和参与。更聪明的出行，更安全的骑行是我们的使命。
